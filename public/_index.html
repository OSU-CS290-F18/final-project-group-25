          <p>I can't say I love templating, but I certainly like the idea. It just seems like so much of the syntax is arbitrary, and that's frustrating. Sure, my server.js file is nice and short, but most of the statements in it are just magic. That isn't to say that I don't understand how it works, though; it just seems like setting the renderer to Handlebars (and all the other setup things) could just as easily be written some other way.</p>
          <p>That said, it was definitely satisfying to see how few lines of code it takes to get that website running. It's a bit frightening how many layers of abstraction are between your lines of HTML and the user's pixels.</p>
          <p>I had some trouble getting the client-side Handlebars stuff set up, but once I had my packages sorted out, it was surprisingly simple to use. I used the class notes extensively to help with all of this and eventually buddied up with a friend to compare the elegance of our solutions.</p>
          <p>One problem that I had was in validing input for the post id when navigating to /posts/#. Originally, I had compared the number to 0 and the array size to make sure it was in bounds, serving 404 if not. This turned out to cause an unforseen issue when navigating to a non-numeric "post id." This ended up displaying a blank card, since the cards array returned empty at that index and it didn't fail the bounds checking! This was pretty easily remedied by skipping the bounds check entirely and just seeing if posts[id] was truthy, returning 404 if not.</p>
